This includes: `set`, `increment`, and\n`replaceWithCounter`.\n\nAll HTTP API Headers used by Ditto will be prefixed with `X-DITTO-`\n\n- `X-HYDRA-ENSURE-DELETE` is now `X-DITTO-ENSURE-DELETE`\n- `X-HYDRA-CLIENT-ID` is now `X-DITTO-CLIENT-ID`\n- `X-HYDRA-ENSURE-INSERT` is now `X-DITTO-ENSURE-INSERT`\n- `X-ENSURE-INSERT` is now `X-DITTO-ENSURE-INSERT`\n\nThe old header names are now deprecated.\n\nHTTP API delete document method now checks for conflicting changes from the\nsame CLIENT-ID. These conflicts would sometimes cause a deletion to be ignored.\nThe HTTP API now will check if the `X-DITTO-ENSURE-DELETE` is present and\nperforms the deletion even when a conflicting add occurrs. Use the\n`X-DITTO-ENSURE-DELETE` header to ensure deletions are commited before the HTTP\nresponse is returned.\n\nAPI users should continue to ensure different instances of the HTTP API Client\ndo *not* share the same value for `X-DITTO-CLIENT-ID` header. Further, batch\nHTTP API requests are preferred to having multiple in-flight Insert, Delete, and\nUpdate API requests are the same time.  \n\nHTTP API Requests have a default timeout of 5 seconds. \n\nImproved the error message for HTTP API Requests targeting unavailable transactions.",
