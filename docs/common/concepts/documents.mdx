Ditto is a NoSQL database, that can store JSON-like Documents organized by Collections. However, unlike JSON, Ditto allows you to apply updates to the document which will be synchronized with any other copy on other devices. In addition, it supports additional data types.

## Collections

You can think of a collection as a table in a traditional database. However,
unlike traditional SQL databases, Ditto's collections are far simpler and more
flexible. A collection is merely referenced by its string value, there is no
need to "create" a collection. Collections are only
referenced once there is at least one document that is related to a collection
name.

While it is typically common for all documents
in a collection to have the same structure, it is not a technical requirement.
For example, all documents referencing cars can go in the "cars" collection and
boat documents in the "boats" collection. You can create any number of
collections that best represent your data model.

To get a reference to a collection:

<SnippetGroup
  name='datamodel' 
/>

## Documents

A Ditto document is a schema flexible unit of data in Ditto. If collections are
similar to tables, then a document is similar to a row. A document, at its
highest level, is a map that can contain arbitrarily nested keys and values.
Each document has a primary key, often referred to as an id.

### Primary Key `_id`

Each document must have a unique identifier called the `_id`. This is
the primary key of the document and is not optional. As an example, let's create
a document in the `people` collection.

<SnippetGroup
  name='upsert' 
/>

The `_id` parameter is optional when you create a document. If you do not supply a
document `_id`, Ditto will automatically generate a random, unique string and
use that as the document's `_id`. 

## Usage

### Supplying the identifier for a document 

You can also also supply your own unique identifier when creating a document. You do this by passing `_id` as a parameter to the `upsert` function:

<SnippetGroup
  name='upsert-id' 
/>


### Composite identifiers

Ditto's `_id` field can be a string or a map of values. For example, we may have
a person document with a unique identifier with two parts: 

* a string `userId`; and
* an integer `workId`. 

We can insert each document as a composite key as a nested
map structure under the `_id` field like so.

<SnippetGroup
  name='upsert-composite-primary-key' 
/>


Note: `_id`s with the same key and values will be equal regardless of their defined order. Thus,  `{a: "foo", b: 1} == { b: 1, a: "foo" }`. This is because Ditto maps check for equality of key and value combinations and do not consider for literal order.
