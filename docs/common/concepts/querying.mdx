Ditto provides a robust query engine that supports different filter operations. At a high-level, all queries work on a specific collection and are used to filter the collection. In addition, since Ditto works with data represented in JSON-compatible documents, the query syntax offers dot notation to reference keys within the document tree as shown below:

<SnippetGroup
  name='query-basic' 
/>

## Using query variables with `$args` 

Often, you will query with runtime variables. Instead of building or
interpolating query strings, the query system will accept variables through an
`$args` dictionary object. 

<SnippetGroup
  name='query-args' 
/>


## Find by `_id`

Every document contains its own unique `_id` property. This property can be set or randomly assigned. When updating a single document within a collection you will most often find that document by its `_id` property. 

```js
// finds the document with the specified _id
findByID("1234")
```

## Sort

Before executing a query, you can specify to sort on a specific property. Call `sort` before a query is executed by specifying a specific property and a sort direction. 

Note: Queries that do not specify a `sort` will assume to sort on the `_id` property.

The following example will sort on documents that have a mileage property

<SnippetGroup
  name='query-sort' 
/>

## Limit 

There are times where you need to limit the number of results that a query returns. Call `limit` before the query is executed to trim the number of results. This is best used with `sort`.

<SnippetGroup
  name='query-limit' 
/>


## Creating query strings

The Ditto query language is very similar to what you'd write in most `if`
statements. In addition, we offer standard, easy-to-understand query condition
operators that most developers should understand.

On the small peer, there are no secondary indexes. Queries such as `status ==
'Active'` will have to perform a full table scan.

## Navigating Document Properties

To refer to keys within the document's property tree, Ditto uses dot notation that should be familiar to most developers. Let's say we have a document like so:


```json
{
   "_id": "123abc",
   "name": { "first": "Alan", "last": "Turing" },
   "contact": { "phone": { "type": "cell", "number": "111-222-3333" } },
   "work": { "street-line": "678 Johnson Street"}
}
```

If you wanted to query for the `last` property nested in `name`, you will need to do the following:

```js
"name.last == 'Turing'"
```

Keys in the query syntax by default must be alphanumeric or include underscore (a-zA-Z0-9_). In addition, the key must start with an alpha characters first (a-zA-Z_). If your key uses another character, such as a hyphen, you must use a __brack syntax__. To query for the `"street-line"` property underneath `"work"`, you will need to do the following: 

```js
"work['street-line'] == '678 Johnson Street'"
```



### Equality `==`, Inequality

```js
// finds documents which have a title equal to Harry Potter.
"title == 'Harry Potter'"

// finds documents which that are not of the title Lord of the Rings
"title != 'Lord of the Rings'"
```

### Comparisons - Greater Or Less Than `>=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`


```js
// finds documents where the age is less than or equal to 18
"age <= 18"
// finds documents where the age is less than to 18
"age < 18"
// finds documents where the age is greater than or equal to 18
"age >= 18"
// finds documents where the age is greater than to 18
"age > 18"
```

### Compound - And `&&`, Or `||`, Not `!`, Contains `contains`


Use `&&` for a logical __and__ Predicate; similar to SQL AND statements. 
```js
// finds documents that have a theme property equal to "Dark" and a name property equally to "Light"
"theme == 'Dark' && name == 'Light'
```

Use `||` for a logical __or__ predicate; similar to SQL OR statements
```js
// finds documents that are "Tom" or "Arthur"
"name == 'Tom' || name == 'Arthur'"
```

Use `!` for a logical __not__ predicate; similar to SQL NOT statements

```js
// finds documents that are neither "Hamilton" nor "Morten"
"!(name == 'Hamilton' || name == 'Morten')"
```

Make sure you wrap all chained boolean operators in parenthesis:


```js
// chained boolean operators need parens
"(theme == 'Dark' && name == 'Light') || finished == false"
```

Use `contains(array, value)` to check if an array contains a value. 

```js
// finds documents who have a `connectionType` property and checks if it equals any of the values in a defined array
"contains(['bluetooth', 'wifidirect'], connectionType)"
```


### String Operations

Use `starts_with(property, test)` to test if a property with a string value __starts__ with a test string

```js
// finds documents with a title property that begins with "Lord"
"starts_with(title, 'Lord')"
```

Use `ends_with(property, test)` to test if a property with a string value __ends__ with a test string

```js
// finds documents with a title property that ends with "Rings"
"ends_with(title, 'Rings')"
```

Use `regex(property, test)` to see if a property with a string value passes a [Regular Expression. Click here for a reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions). 

```js
// finds documents which has a title property that only comprises of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. 
"regex(title, '^([A-Za-z]|[0-9]|_)+$')"

// A title property of "abc129_24A" will pass
// A title property of "abc129_24A  3" will not pass
```

### Dates

Queries also parse ISO-8601 date strings as comparable dates:

```js
"created_at >= '2022-04-29T00:55:31.859Z'"
```


### Booleans

Use when your property is of type Boolean, use `value == false` or `value == true` explicitly.

```js
//finds documents which have an 'isDeleted' boolean propety set to `true`
"isDeleted == true"
```

```js
//finds documents which have an 'isDeleted' boolean propety set to `false`
"isDeleted == false"
```
