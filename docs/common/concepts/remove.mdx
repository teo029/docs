Removes will delete or remove one or more documents from the collection. Calling
remove __will sync removals to the local device and to other devices as well__. 

:::danger
Removing documents will remove documents from the local device _and other
peers_. Your application code should consider `remove`  calls to be destructive.
In other words, if you call remove on document, your application should consider
this document _gone_ throughout your system.
::::

### Remove by _id

Removing by document _id is permanent. You cannot create a new document with the
same `_id` at a later time.

<SnippetGroup
  name='remove-id' 
/>

### Soft-delete documents

Consider using a "soft-delete" pattern in your application. You should use a
field like `isArchived: true` instead of calling `remove()`. You can query and
synchronize only the documents that have not been marked archived. Using a
soft-delete pattern, documents can be synced or updated again if necessary. 

```json
{
  "_id": "123abc",
  "name": "Foo",
  "isArchived": true // add this field
}
```

And query non-archived documents like so:

```js
let liveQuery = ditto
  .store.collection('cars')
  .find('!isArchived').observeLocal((documents) => {
    console.log('these are the unarchived documents', documents)
  })
```

You can easily un-archive these documents by calling update on that field:

```js
ditto.store.collection('cars').update((mutableDoc) => {
  mutableDoc["isArchived"] = false
})
```


### Evicting documents

Once you archive a document, you can delete it from the local device to free up
disk space. This operation is different than remove in that it only removes one
or more documents from the local on-disk storage.

  name='evict'
