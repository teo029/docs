Ditto is a distributed database that optimizes for availability, which means
that you can always write to your local database even if you are disconnected
from the internet. Writes from all peers will synchronize and Ditto will resolve
any conflicts.

Ditto uses a delta state CRDT, which means Ditto only replicates data if it has changed. This makes Ditto very fast.

## Upserting 

Ditto doesn't have a concept of "inserting" data, only "upserting" data. This
means that each device must assume that their operations are modifying
documents that may already exist on some other device in the network. This is because it is
possible that the current device just hasn't synchronized that document yet.

### Creating a document

If you do not supply an `id`, Ditto will create one for you and return it. Note that the `id` is
immutable.  This means that you cannot change the `id` once you have created the document.
 
<SnippetGroup name="upsert" />


As an example, let's say we have a document in the `people` collection that looks like this:

```jsonc
{
  "_id": "123abc",
  "name": "Sam",
  "age": 45,
  "isOnline": false
}
```

When you `upsert` a document, only the supplied fields will be modified. Existing fields are left unmodified. 

<SnippetGroup
  name='upsert-id' 
/>

This results in the `name` and `age` changing, but `isOnline` is untouched:

```jsonc
{
  "_id": "123abc",
  "name": "Susan",
  "age": 31,
  "isOnline": false
}
```
### Default Data

Default Data can be thought of as "placeholder" data.  Default Data is useful when your app needs to load "starter" data from an external data source, like from a backend API, on multiple devices. Ditto's approach to conflict resolution orders changes by time. In most situations, this leads to predictable behavior. However, if your application is upserting the same initial data into multiple devices, such as common data from a central backend API, this could result in overwriting later changes:

1. Device A upserts a document `{"firstName": "Adam"}` at time = 0 after downloading from a central API.
2. Device A updates the document to `{"firstName": "Max"}` at time = 1.
3. Device B synchronizes with Device A receiving the document `{"firstName": "Max"}` at time = 2.
4. Device B downloads the same document from the backend API `{"firstName": "Adam"}` and upserts at t = 3, which overwrites the previous change synced at time = 1

In the above example, both Device A and B want to preserve the change by Device A that occurred after downloading the common data. To do so, Ditto offers an additional parameter: isDefault. 

:::warning
If you insert the same data on each peer without using the default data API, each device will accumulate unbounded metadata, which could cause the local disk space to grow infinitely.

## Updating existing documents

Updating an existing document is different depending on the type being updated

[Register](../datamodel/register)

* Set - sets value for a given key in the document
* Remove - removes a value for a given key in the document

[Counter](../datamodel/counter)

* Replace with counter - will convert a number value for a given key into a counter
* Increment - unlike a number, a counter allows for increment operations (decrement is performed by incrementing by a negative increment) and these operations will converge

[Map](../datamodel/map)

* Set - sets value for a given key in the map
* Remove - removes a value for a given key in the map

  name='update'

### What is the difference between `upsert` and `update`?





## Batching multiple updates in a single transaction

A write transaction allows a device to perform multiple operations within a
single database call, that will be synchronized at the same time to other
devices. You can perform insert, update, remove or evict operations on multiple
collections more efficiently using this method.

:::warning
You cannot combine `remove()` and `upsert()` on the same document in the same write transaction. This is because you cannot update a document that has been removed.
:::

<SnippetGroup name="write-transaction" />

### Multi threading on updating list of contents

When writing many documents to a small peer, you can start the transaction
asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread. For example, in Swift you can
use `DispatchQueue.global`. The syntax is different for other languages but the
concept is the same.

```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).async {

	ditto.store.write { transaction in

		let scope = transaction.scoped(toCollectionNamed: "passengers-\(thisFlight)")

    // Loop inside the transaction to avoid writing to database too frequently
		self.passengers.forEach {
			scope.upsert($0.dict)
		}
	}
}
```


## Blocked transactions

:::warning
You cannot start a write transaction within an update clause or a write transaction. 
:::

At any given time, there can be only one write transaction. Any subsequent
attempts to open another write transaction will become blocked and not progress
until the existing write transaction finishes. The process of unblocking is
automatic and you don’t need to write any code to handle this.

The following code will create a deadlock which **never** resolves itself.


```swift
// Start a write transaction:
ditto.store["people"].findByID(docID).update { mutableDoc in
  // Start a write transaction _within_ a write transacton.
  // !! Deadlocks !!
  let docID = try! ditto.store["settings"].upsert([
      "_id": "abc123",
      "preference": 31,
  ]) 
  // ...
}
```

This might manifest itself in the logs as: 

`LOG_LEVEL: Waiting for write transaction (elapsed: XXs), originator=User blocked_by=User`

If the transaction never unblocks and the log messages at `ERROR` level continue
forever - you have a strong indication that there’s a deadlock and should
investigate the application code.
