There are instances where you may want to configure additional connections configurations for the current Ditto instance. This section will teach you how to configure your Ditto instance to listen for connections on a port explicitly and to connect to remote instances via a host (IP) and port. To do this, _before_ you call `startSync()`, construct a `DittoTransportConfig` value and set `ditto.SetTransportConfig`.

Ditto will automatically attempt to connect to other ditto instances on
the Local Area Network, Bluetooth, and AWDL. However, if you supply a
`DittoTransportConfig`, this will not automatically be enabled. You'll need to
remember to enable peer to peer connnections with `EnableAllPeerToPeer()`.  

## Enabling/Disabling Transports

You can enable all peer to peer connections with `EnableAllPeerToPeer()`. You can also customize which transports are used by enabling/disabling each transport separately.

<SnippetGroup name="transport-configurations" />

## Sync to Ditto Cloud

The big peer generates certificates automatically for each small peer. A certificate involves an expiration date and AppID, among other credentials. Read more here about how it works.

In order to sync with other devices, a peer must connect to the Big Peer at least once. To do this, you must use either [OnlinePlayground](./online-playground) or [OnlineWithAuthentication](../security/authentication). 

We recommend using OnlinePlayground for development and OnlineWithAuthentication for production apps. If you only want to use the Big Peer for authentication without syncing to the cloud, you can useÂ `enableDittoCloudSync=false`.  `enableDittoCloudSync` is set to true by default.

<SnippetGroup name="online-playground-cloudSync" />


## Observing Peers 

Ditto always monitors the mesh network and can report the device names of peers
it is connected to. You can manually set the device name of those peers and
observe those peers in the network.

:::info
The device name must be set before `startSync()` is called.
:::

<SnippetGroup name="device-name" />

If you want to observe changes made by a particular
device, include the device name as a field in the document and query for that field in
your [ditto live query](../concepts/querying)

```
"status == 'open' && edited_by == 'deviceC'"
```


## Sync Groups

When peer-to-peer transports are enabled, all devices with the same App ID will
form an interconnected mesh network. If you have knowledge ahead of time that
devices are in distinct groups that should only sync with each other, you can
optimize performance by restricting them from syncronizing with each other. 

The `syncGroup` parameter provides this functionality. A device can only ever be
in one sync group, which by default is group 0. Up to 2^32 distinct group
numbers can be used in an app. Using a sync group is more performant, and is
recommended in any case where this knowledge is known ahead of time.

<p style={{"width": '500px'}}>

:::info
For example, imagine an application that supports two different restaurant
locations: 1234 and 7890. When a device identifies itself to the Big Peer, it gives its 
location ID as part of the authentication callback. Before calling
`startSync()`, you can use a different sync group for each restaurant. Only
restaurants in the same sync group will sync with eachother.

:::info
#### Note: sync groups are not a security mechanism
Sync groups are an optimization, not a security control. If a connection is created
manually, such as by specifying a `connect` transport, then devices from
different sync groups will still sync as normal. If two groups of devices are
intended to have access to different data sets, this must be enforced using
Ditto's permissions system.

## Connecting to a Remote Ditto Peer

If you know the host and port of another remote Ditto peer and would like to connect to it, construct a `DittoTransportConfig` object and add the host and port to the `DittoTransportConfig.Connect.TcpServers` property as a `string`. The string format should be `host:port`, separated by a colon.

In the example below, we know of two other Ditto peers located on:

* Host IP `135.1.5.5` at port `12345`
* Host IP `185.1.5.5` at port `4567`


<SnippetGroup name="network-remote-ditto" />

Feel free to add as many known remote `host:port` strings.

## Listening for Connections on a Specific Port

You can enable the Ditto instance to listen for incoming connections from other
remotes Ditto peers on a specific port. You can think of this as setting up your
Ditto as a "server" that can listen to connections from other peers.

In this example, we would like our Ditto instance to listen to _incoming_ connections on port `4000` on `0.0.0.0`. 

:::info
To be safe, please do not use `localhost` when setting the IP interface. Use `"0.0.0.0"` instead.
:::

<SnippetGroup name="network-listen" />


Incoming connections from other Ditto peers will be able to connect only if the
port is accessible. Depending on your deployment _be sure to check that external
connections can reach the port_ that you have specified in your configuration.
You may need to set up port forwarding if external ports map differently to your
host.

You can also configure your Ditto instance to connect to a websocket

<SnippetGroup name="websocket-connect" />


## Combining Multiple Transports

You can specify several modes of transport configuration within `DittoTransportConfig`. The following snippet shows you a ditto instance that can:

1. Connect to local area network devices
2. Listen for incoming remote connections
3. Connect to remote devices with a known host and port. 

<SnippetGroup name="network-multiple-transports" />

## Monitoring Transport Conditions

If syncing over Bluetooth LE is a critical part of your application you may want
to warn the user if they are missing the permission or if the hardware is
disabled. Ditto will help you by reporting conditions via a delegate or callback
object.

First, while configuring Ditto, assign a delegate or a callback to receive notifications.
