## Do not deploy to the app store
Shared key is not suitable for apps deployed to the public app store, because the key could be reverse-engineered. Shared key is more appropriate for an enterprise application run on centrally managed devices that do not connect to the Internet.

If you need to synchronize data over the Internet with the Big Peer, [use Online With Authentication instead](./authentication).

Ditto offers an intermediate level of security for applications where all users
and devices are trusted. For example, this could be appropriate for an
enterprise application run on centrally managed devices. In this mode, every
device knows the same secret key, and uses this to validate incoming
connections. The benefit of this approach is that distinct certificates do not
have to be distributed to every device, simplifying the deployment.


Small Peers in this mode use a `SharedKey` identity type. The secret key must be provided as a
String when initializing the `DittoIdentity` on each peer. This key should be securely and randomly generated and Ditto
expects it to be in a particular format.

The recommended way to generate a shared key is to download Ditto's open source cross-platform utility
[`ditto-authtool`](https://github.com/getditto/authtool), which provides an easy command to generate new shared keys
from a terminal or command prompt:

```console
./ditto-authtool generate-shared-key
```

or

```console
.\ditto-authtool.exe generate-shared-key
```

Alternatively, if you have a Linux machine running an up-to-date version of OpenSSL then you can use the following
command. At time of writing this will not work on Macs.

```console
openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -outform pem | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform der | base64 -w 0
```

:::info
The SharedKey identity requires an offline-only license token, which can be requested by contacting support@ditto.live.

### How does Shared Key work?

Communication is encrypted using TLS 1.3 and peer identities are verified using certificates. This is the same state-of-the-art technology used in web browsers. It applies to every communication mode from Bluetooth to WiFi.

Each device issues a self-signed TLS certificate using the supplied private key. Peers then only trust peers whose certificates are signed by the same key. In other words, Shared Key uses regular TLS security, except everybody is the CA.
