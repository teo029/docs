## Svelte

If you are using Svelte, remember to keep your Ditto instance and subscriptions
alive for the duration of the program by using `writable`:

```js
import { writable } from "svelte/store";

let ditto = writable([]);
let subscription = writable([]);

ditto.set(new Ditto(identity))
subscription.set($ditto.store.collections("cars").find("color == 'red'").subscribe())
```
