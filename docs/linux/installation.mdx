# Linux & Raspberry Pi

Ditto supports recent versions of Raspberry Pi and some other Linux-based systems

These instructions are required to run Ditto on Linux regardless of the programming language. This applies to all SDKs, including 
JavaScript (Node/Electron), C#, C++, etc.

# System preparation for happy Ditto operation

## Bluetooth Low Energy - BlueZ

If you would like to run Ditto on a Linux device and leverage Bluetooth Low
Energy please follow the instructions. 

Your device will need to install or update BlueZ with version 5.66 or higher.
We've outlined a quick snippet set of instructions below to install BlueZ 5.66 as an example:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev docutils-common -y
wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.66.tar.xz
tar -xf bluez-5.66.tar.xz
cd bluez-5.66
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Add support for Linux to iOS connections.

BlueZ 5.51 and above try to automatically read the battery status/service of
devices when they connect. However, by default, iOS devices will prevent BlueZ
services from reading the battery service. As a result, BlueZ connection
attempts will cause iOS devices to show a pairing prompt constantly. Therefore,
we will need to disable the battery service in BlueZ, using the following steps.  

1. With your favorite editor, open the bluetooth service file. On Raspberry Pi OS it's located: `/usr/lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service`,
on other versions it may be here: `/etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.target.wants/bluetooth.service`.  
You will probably need to use su permission to write to this file.

2. Find the line beginning with `ExecStart=` and add `-P battery` to the end. Now the line should look like this:

```
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd -P battery
```

3. Save the file.
4. Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` and `sudo systemctl restart bluetooth` to apply the changes to the Bluetooth service

After that, BlueZ should be able to connect to iOS devices without prompting and
Ditto Apps should be able to communicate over BT-LE between iOS and Linux.

### Run the following command to set BlueZ' support for multiple advertisements.

```
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' `which hcitool` 
```

Your Linux system is now ready to install and run Ditto.

[See here](https://docs.ditto.live/javascript/installation) for Node.js SDK.  
[See here](https://docs.ditto.live/rust/installation) for Rust SDK.  
The Python and C++ SDKs are in development. If you would like early access, please [contact us](https://www.ditto.live/about/contact)

# Linux demo application (Node.js)

Demo Ditto syncing from your Raspberry Pi to your iOS or Android device, over Bluetooth LE or WLAN using our Tasks App:

1) Make sure you've gone though the steps to prepare your system (see above). 
2) Install Node Version Manager on your Pi.  

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
```
Now restart your terminal session so the changes can be picked up.

3) Install the LTS version of Node.js (v18.13) on your Pi.  

```
nvm install 18.13
```

4) Clone the samples app repo to your machine.  

```
git clone https://github.com/getditto/samples.git
cd samples/tasks/nodejs/
```

Edit the index.ts file to include your own test App ID and Token from https://portal.ditto.live

5) Run the demo app!.  
```
npm install
npm run build
node index.js
```

You should see this in your Pi's console:
```
************* Commands *************
--insert my new task
   Inserts a task
   Example: "--insert Get Milk"
--toggle myTaskTd
   Toggles the isComplete property to the opposite value
   Example: "--toggle 1234abc"
--delete myTaskTd
   Deletes a task
   Example: "--delete 1234abc"
--list
   List the current tasks
--exit
   Exits the program
************* Commands *************
Your command:
```

6) Create a new task and then check to see it being updated in our [handy data browser](https://portal.ditto.live).  
You'll need to log in and view the test app ID you created earlier.  

7) Now build and run the Tasks app for iOS or Android.  
Be sure to reuse the same App ID and Token as you used on your Pi.  
iOS / Android examples are [here](https://github.com/getditto/samples/tree/main/tasks).
